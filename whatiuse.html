        <h2 id="desktop-os-linux-mint-cinnamon">Desktop OS: Linux Mint Cinnamon</h2>
        <p>It was my first Linux distro when I made the switch in high school and it’s stuck with me ever since. Highly recommend it to anyone switching from Windows. It’s reliable for the most part and quite easy to set up and get going. I installed it on a (for lack of a better term) normie friend’s old laptop, and she used it perfectly fine for school with no oversight or assistance.</p>
        
        <h2 id="laptop-framework-13">Laptop: Framework 13</h2>
        <p>I got this laptop for exactly the reason’s everyone else got it. The price-to-performance is honestly a little shit, but it was my graduation present, and the prospect of being able to repair every aspect of my own laptop was too good to pass up as a soon-to-be broke college student. It has served me quite well.</p>

        <h2 id="brawl-melee">Brawl/Melee</h2>
        <p>For Brawl (my main game) and Melee, I use an indigo OEM that’s older than me. It’s far from perfect, but I’m so used to it that it feels more like an extension of Livy than a controller (plus it’s got sentimental value :3).</p>

        <p>This thing rocks. It's my alarm in the morning. It's my timer so I know when to rinse my hair after conditioning. It's even a watch. Hell yeah.</p>
