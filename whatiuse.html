        <p>This page will be updated occasionally with whatever I’m currently using.</p>
        
        <h1 id="productivity-tools">Productivity Tools</h1>
        
        <h2 id="desktop-os-linux-mint-cinnamon">Desktop OS: Linux Mint Cinnamon</h2>
        <p>It was my first Linux distro when I made the switch in high school and it’s stuck with me ever since. Highly recommend it to anyone switching from Windows. It’s reliable for the most part and quite easy to set up and get going. I installed it on a (for lack of a better term) normie friend’s old laptop, and she used it perfectly fine for school with no oversight or assistance.</p>
        
        <h2 id="laptop-framework-13">Laptop: Framework 13</h2>
        <p>I got this laptop for exactly the reason’s everyone else got it. The price-to-performance is honestly a little shit, but it was my graduation present, and the prospect of being able to repair every aspect of my own laptop was too good to pass up as a soon-to-be broke college student. It has served me quite well.</p>
        <p>Current config:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ryzen 5 7640U</li>
            <li>1x16GB DDR5</li>
            <li>250GB SSD (most of my computer is just text files so I really don’t need much)</li>
            <li>Original glossy display</li>
            <li>Expansion cards:
                <ul>
                    <li>1 HDMI</li>
                    <li>1 USB-A</li>
                    <li>2 USB-C</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="text-editors-obsidian-vscodium">Text editors: Obsidian/VSCodium</h2>
        <p>As much as everyone shits on VSCode, it really does offer a pretty remarkable package for the average codemonkey. I use Codium because fuck Microsoft.</p>
        <p>Obsidian is just a pretty solid note-taking app. I don’t use any of the fancy features though because those are for nerds.</p>
        <p>(I also boot up nano in a pinch every once in a while)</p>
        
        <h1 id="this-website">This Website</h1>
        <p>This entire thing is basically run off the Neocities CLI tool. It’s definitely more optimal to use something like Eleventy so I could just generate posts from markdown, but I kinda feel like it’s part of the charm to fumble with the individual HTML of every page.</p>
        
        <h1 id="smash-bros">Smash Bros</h1>
        
        <h2 id="brawl-melee">Brawl/Melee</h2>
        <p>For Brawl (my main game) and Melee, I use an indigo OEM that’s older than me. It’s far from perfect, but I’m so used to it that it feels more like an extension of Livy than a controller (plus it’s got sentimental value :3).</p>
        <p>Specs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Snapback module</li>
            <li>Long plug (right trigger)</li>
            <li>Replaced left stick potentiometer</li>
            <li>Disconnected motor</li>
            <li>Nijika ^-^</li>
        </ul>

        <div>
            <img src="nijika.png" alt="My Brawl/Melee GCC" width="400">
        </div>
        
        <h2 id="ultimate">Ultimate</h2>
        <p>Okay TECHNICALLY at the time of writing I’m still using my wife’s jank ass spare GCC for Ult, but it’s absolutely horrible, and I already placed the order for my new Ult controller so I’m just gonna pretend I have it.</p>
        <p>If you’re wondering why I don’t just use my Brawl controller, it’s cause the plug in the trigger doesn’t register digital presses properly in Ultimate.</p>
        <p>Specs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sunburnt JP White shell</li>
            <li>Replaced left stickbox</li>
            <li>Snapback module</li>
            <li>Shortened springs</li>
            <li>Disconnected motor</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1 id="audio">Audio</h1>
        
        <h2 id="in-ear-airpods-pro-2">In-Ear: AirPods Pro 2</h2>
        <p>Very very solid earbuds (as you’d expect from the price). The sound quality is great, as you’d expect, but the best part by far is the noise canceling and transparency modes. My autistic ass cannot handle loud environments very well, so putting these on in transparency mode has come in clutch many a time.</p>
        
        <h2 id="over-ear-soundcore-q20i">Over-Ear: Soundcore Q20i</h2>
        <p>The opposite of the AirPods in that they punch way above their weight class. They sound pretty shit out of the box (mostly because of the bass boost mode that’s on by default and requires their app to disable), but once they’re set up and EQ’d, they sound very solid, are very comfortable, and have insane battery life.</p>
        
        <h1 id="misc">Misc.</h1>
        
        <h2 id="backpack-pelican-mbp20">Backpack: Pelican MBP20</h2>
        <p>I got this backpack on a crazy sale before starting uni, like almost 50% off. I think it was on such crazy sale cause they were discontinuing it, which is a shame, because this backpack is a beast. Super durable, super water-resistant, and just big enough for my use case. The giant front pocket with the vertical zipper confused me at first, but I’ve come to love it.</p>
