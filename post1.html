                <p>Hello chatroom I am Livy. I regret to inform you that society has yet
                to find a way to purge all things resembling “blogs” from the internet.
                This means I will be posting whatever longer-form thoughts I have on
                here.</p>
                <p>There will also be some other stuff, namely link aggregation for cool
                stuff I find, messing around with whatever webdev stuff I’m interested
                in at any given moment, the stuff you’d expect from a girl who describes
                herself like <em>that</em> running a website that looks like
                <em>this</em>.</p>
                <p>Oh and a few ground rules before I go:
                    <ul>
                        <li>We push directly to production here, no pussy shit. Will probably break the site regularly.</li>
                        <li>See the licence disclaimer if you’re a nerd. </li>
                        <li>The proper URL for this site will eveeentually be livy.gay. I’m hosting through neocities which requires u to pay for the right to use a fully custom domain u own and, like, $5 a month is a tad expensive right now chat</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Oh and here’s some credits. I should probably make a dedicated footer
                or page or something for this soon. we’ll see. it’s 5am.
                <ul>
                    <li>This website uses the SLSO8 pallet created by Luis Miguel Maldonado and the Early Gameboy font by Jimmy Campbell</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Uhh yeah that’s it for now I guess? bye bye!</p>
