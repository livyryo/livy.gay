                    It's early spring. You're 15. Monster Rehab iced tea lemonade. The Pillows blasting in your ears. 
                    You're at the top of the tallest hill in town. Dead quiet. No cars. 
                    You get a moving start and push off on your skateboard. Knees bent, 
                    leaning into every curve and slope like it's second nature. The tactile 
                    sensation of polyurethane on pavement, the flex of the deck, the instant 
                    feedback to every shift of body weight and adjustment of your feet. The feeling 
                    of taking precise control over a once unwieldy system of movement, achieving 
                    agility that once seemed impossible, the realm of professionals and people online. 
                    Sometimes you hit a rock and eat shit, but fuck it. You feel like you're flying.

                <p> It's late winter. You're 18. Monster Rehab iced tea lemonade. 
                    The Pillows blasting in your ears. You're at a psuedo-PC cafe, part of the campus 
                    esports department. You're on slippi. You've played a couple games against a falco 
                    named "meleeplayer". Spiky Seeds plays on shuffle. You switch to fox. You hit every 
                    ledgedash and waveshine like it's second nature. The tactile sensation of plastic 
                    clacking against plastic, the click of the triggers, the instant feedback to every 
                    stick movement and button press. The feeling of taking precise control over a once 
                    unwieldy system of movement, achieving agility that once seemed impossible, the realm 
                    of professionals and people online. Sometimes you misinput and eat shit, but fuck it. 
                        You feel like you're flying.</p>
